I put this site together using [this helpful guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) on GitHub. I'll write a more detailed post of exactly what I did/modified once I'm done, but you can also check out the git history for an idea of that as well. That's one of the best parts of this whole 'git' thing. Also, I can use Markdown to author my posts, which is pretty easy to use. If you're not sure what Mardown is, checking out the links page for links to the original Markdown and GitHub Flavored Markdown. It is pretty easy and fun, if you're into that sort of thing.
